libkeepass
==========

Python module to read KeePass 1.x/KeePassX (v3) and KeePass 2.x (v4) files.

Warning
-------

"this code makes no attempt to secure its memory"

Requirements
------------

 - PyCrypto

KeePass 1.x support
-------------------

Currently the reader only goes so far, as outputting the raw decrypted data.
Parsing into groups and entries is missing and probably just needs to be 
integrated from Brett Viren's work.

KeePass 2.x support
-------------------

The v4 reader can output the decrypted XML document that format is based on.
It is also available as parsed objectified element tree.

The v4 reader supports passwords and key-file protection.

In v4 the password elements are protected in addition to the AES encryption of
the whole database.

There is basic "save as" write support. The opened decrypted database is held in
the in-buffer and parsed into an element tree, which can be modified. When
writing the KeePass file, the element tree is serialized, compressed and
encrypted according to the settings in the file header and written to a stream.

Examples
--------

    import keepass
    
    filename = "input.kdbx"
    with keepass.open(filename, password='secret', keyfile='putty.exe') as kdb:
        # print parsed element tree as xml
        print kdb.pretty_print()
        
        # re-encrypt the password fields
        kdb.protect()
        print kdb.pretty_print()
        
        # or use kdb.obj_root to access the element tree
        kdb.obj_root.findall('.//Entry')
        
        # write to a new file
        with open('output', 'wb') as output:
            kdb.write_to(output)

References
----------

Initially Brett Viren's code was a starting point and some of his code is being
re-used unchanged (https://github.com/brettviren/python-keepass).

For v4 support reading the original Keepass2 C# source was used as inspiration
(http://keepass.info).

Keepass 2.x uses Salsa20 to protect data in XML. Currently puresalsa20 is used
(http://www.tiac.net/~sw/2010/02/PureSalsa20/index.html) and included.

Thanks to them and all others who came before are in order.
